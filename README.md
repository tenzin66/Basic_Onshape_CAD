## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)
* very easy to understand

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

### Reflection


* very simple to understand
* you didn't need to make new part which was nice.
* vertical line (shortcut v)
* variables (change the thickness of parts)



## Fork

### Description

Fork for the caster.

### Reflection

It was simple like the rest, but It was a little challenging. It introduced stuff that I didn't know about.
* chamfer 
* concentric
* Fillet
